# pokemon-CLI-downloader

A simple CLI program to download information about your favorite pokemon.

I made this project to practice using npm packages, modules, and API's

- 100% javascript
- Inquirer
- Fetch
- Path
- fs

there is a bug in the end where it asks if you would like to search for another pokemon. You have to answer it twice for it to work. I believe it is a bug within inquirer.
